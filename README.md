This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict user purchasing behavior on an e-commerce platform. Using a large Kaggle dataset with 2+ million logged events, I engineered features from raw clickstream data and trained a classification model with XGBoost, handled severeclass imbalance, tuned parameters to maximize F1, and achieved an F1-score of 0.74.
